In a fortune-telling game
We were matched with one another
She was the beautiful queen of hearts
And I was the Jack of Clubs
Midnight, that Thursday
I ran into her on the bridge
"Don't cry" I told her, yet she did
As she stepped down from the railing
Is your hair wet, or is it wet to live, I asked
Is there always rain in the wind for you?
Are you lost in thoughts, or are you bored of questions?
Does the autumn never leave your eyes?
Be a snowflake, land on the tip of my tongue
A snowflake, melt in my mouth
She was soaked, she undressed
She touched my body.
On my slightly rough skin,
She found my life cells.
I was happy, she fell asleep
I held her as she mumbled in her sleep
The names I didn't know
Barenaked by my side
Is your hair wet, or is it wet to live, I asked
Is there always rain in the wind for you?
Are you lost in thoughts, or are you bored with questions?
Does the autumn never leave your eyes?
I was proud in my dream, "I knew", I said.
It turns out you must believe fortune-telling games.
I woke, and kept staring
At the writing an imaginary finger left
On the mist of the window
"Goodbye"
